<!-- 1. The forecast today is 293 Kelvin. To start, create a variable named kelvin, and set it equal to 293.

The value saved to kelvin will stay constant. Choose the variable type with this in mind.

2. Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

3. Celsius is similar to Kelvin — the only difference is that Celsius is 273 degrees less than Kelvin.

Let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius by subtracting 273 from the kelvin variable. Store the result in another variable, named celsius.

4. Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

5. Use this equation to calculate Fahrenheit, then store the answer in a variable named fahrenheit.

Fahrenheit = Celsius * (9/5) + 32

6. Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

7. When you convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you often get a decimal number. (Don't worry about this just yet). Log the temperature in farenheit to the console. -->
